                <h3>Retirement Model Lab</h3>
                <p>This project helps calculate the years until retirement based on savings rate and investment return.</p>

                <h4>Python Code</h4>
                <pre><code class="language-python">
# Imports / Variables

## Imports

import numpy
import numpy_financial as np

## Variables

salary = 60000
savings_rate = [0.10, 0.25, 0.40]
investment_rate = [0.04, 0.05, 0.06]
desired_cash = 1500000
saved_cash = 0

## Calculations

for s_rate in savings_rate:
    annual_cash = salary * s_rate
    for i_rate in investment_rate:
        years_to_retirement = np.nper(i_rate,-annual_cash,saved_cash,desired_cash)
        print(f'Martha has {years_to_retirement:.1f} years to retirement if she earns a {i_rate:.0%} return and saves {s_rate:.0%}.')
                </code></pre>
